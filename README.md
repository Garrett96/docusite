## Set Up

1] Fork the repository. Ideally make the fork a private repo.
<br>
2] Sign into [Vercel](https://vercel.com) with your GitHub account. Add vercel permissions to the forked repository.
<br>
3] Deploy the repository on Vercel. Check that the generated URL works.
<br>
4] Jump straight into editing the markdown files inside of GitHub.
<br>
5] (*Optional*) Clone the Repo with GitHub Desktop and open with your preferred IDE for a more comfortable experience editing content and adding image assets.
<br>
6] (*Optional*) In `mkdocs.yml` uncomment password plugin and set a global password.
<br>
<br>
The `Site` directory will always be overwritten when `mkdocs build` runs. To ensure you save time and sanity, always adjust the content in the `Docs` directory; especially when adding images.
