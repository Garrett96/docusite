## About

DocuSite is a modification of MkDocs designed to deploy on Vercel that streamlines the setup process regardless of technical aptitude, so you can immediately jump into working on documentation content and bringing that to your team, clients, project stakeholders, and anyone adjacent that might need to see something in greater detail.

## Set Up

1] Fork the repository 
<br>
2] Sign into [Vercel](https://vercel.com) with your GitHub account. Add vercel permissions to the forked repository.
<br>
3] Deploy the repository on Vercel.
<br>
4] If the Vercel URL works, you can jump straight into editing the content right inside of GitHub. 
<br>
5] (Optional) Clone the Repo with GitHub Desktop and open with your preferred IDE for a more comfortable experience editing content and adding image assets.

## Use Cases

Ideal for small-to-medium businessse that just need something that works really quickly and for free. Works great for specific projects with lots of stakeholders or gritty details.

## Dependencies

DocuSite is a streamlined MkDocs deployment via Vercel. It also works best if it lives on GitHub, although this isn't strictly necessary. Updates regarding security or other politices from MkDocs, Vercel, and GitHub are considerations for longevity and any security concerns.
