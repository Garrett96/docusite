## Use Cases & Dependencies

Ideal for small-to-medium businessse that just need something that works really quickly and for free. Works great for specific projects with lots of stakeholders or gritty details. Potential use case for educators or administrative staff.
<br><br>
Works best if it lives on GitHub, although this isn't strictly necessary. Updates regarding security or other politices from MkDocs, Vercel, and GitHub are considerations for longevity and any security concerns.

## Password Protection Disclosure Statement

The password protection guards the main contents of pages. The option is there to keep anyone anywhere from being able to read everything, which is good enough for most use cases. It's not suitable for anything related to national security or corporate trade secrets, but it works.
